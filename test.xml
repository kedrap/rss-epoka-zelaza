In this episode I talk about what I feel to be requirements in developing mobile applications.  I've broken these requirements into three main categories, being, the planning requirement, the execution requirement, and the post release marketing requirement.  Have you ever wondered the fees for releasing your application to the various app stores or what kind of development hardware you need?  Get all the information you need to get your app development business kick started.

In this episode I talk about my experience as a mobile developer and some of the native and hybrid apps that I've published to the various app stores like, but not limited to, Google Play and iTunes.  As a developer that has used both native and hybrid for development, I discuss where I feel native mobile app development succeeds and also where it falls short, making room for hybrid technologies like Apache Cordova, Xamarin, and Telerik NativeScript.

In this episode I'm joined by two of my good friends Simon Reimler and Ray Camden where we discuss some of the software, tools and services available that can boost development and marketing productivity of your next big application.  I've broken this episode into three main categories, being, tools used for planning before development or design, tools used for development and designing an application up to its release, and tools for maintaining and driving the success of an application after its been released.  You'll get to know what we're using and how it might help you out in any of your development adventures.

I've broken this episode into a few parts.  We're going to discuss mobile first development, API first development, and offline first development and how you should choose between them when planning or developing an application.

In this episode I'm joined by TJ VanToll, Developer Advocate at Telerik, where we discuss the cross platform mobile development framework NativeScript.  We cover everything from what is NativeScript, what do you need to start developing NativeScript applications, and how it differs or why you should use it versus native development or development with a different hybrid mobile framework.  TJ talks about where things are headed when it comes to mobile development, who is using Telerik NativeScript to develop apps, and how Angular 2 fits into the framework.  This is the most exciting episode yet on The Polyglot Developer Podcast and I recommend listening to it if you're interested in mobile application development, whether it be for personal or for your business.

In this episode I am joined by Nolan Lawson, one of the main contributors on the PouchDB open source project.  We discuss everything from what is PouchDB, what does it do under the covers, what development platforms are supported, and what does it aim to accomplish that might have been particularly difficult with another tool.  This episode is targeted towards web and mobile developers who include JavaScript as one of the core technologies in their stack because PouchDB is in fact a JavaScript wrapper.

I've personally used PouchDB in the past because it makes it incredibly easy to synchronize data with remote databases via a web or mobile application.  If you're investigating sync solutions, Nolan and I have you covered in this episode.

In this episode I am joined by Ben Lesh, a senior software engineer at Netflix.  Ben is one of the lead developers for RxJS, a reactive extension set for JavaScript, and a core component in the software stack at Netflix.  Here we discuss everything from what is RxJS, to how it differs from common promises and callbacks in JavaScript.  We also discuss who is using it and how it is playing a critical role in Angular 2.

In this episode I am joined by Tracy Lee, owner of Modern Web and advocate of Ember.js, as well as Taras Mankovski who runs Ember Sherpa.  Here we discuss a very popular JavaScript framework called Ember.js and the conveniences it offers in comparison to other, possibly similar front-end frameworks like React and Angular.  This episode includes information on tooling and development best practices as well.

Here we take some time to explain what continuous integration and deployment is and how to get started with it in your development process.  GitLab offers a free CI / CD solution called GitLab CI, but there are other solutions such as Jenkins and Travis CI as well.

In this episode I am joined by Matt Holt, creator of the very popular web server known as Caddy. Instead of focusing on Caddy in this particular episode, we focus on the Go programming language, which was used to make Caddy so successful.

The Go programming language, sometimes referred to as Golang, is a very popular alternative to languages like PHP and Node.js because it is very fast, efficient, and lightweight in comparison. Both Matt and I explore why this is and how you can use it in your own applications.

In this episode I am joined by Krishna Srinivas, engineer at the open source object storage company, Minio.

Krishna and I discuss object storage which is different than database storage or plain filesystem storage. A popular object solution is Amazon S3, but it is not the only solution. Object storage is great for protecting data from corruption or loss as well as providing a great way to work with it via standard HTTP. This makes it great for application development.

In this episode I am joined by Ryan Chenkie, Developer Advocate at the internet safety company, Auth0.

Ryan and I discuss OAuth and how it can be used for authorizing third-party access to your data.

If you've been keeping up, you'll remember that I wrote the very popular ng-cordova-oauth and ng2-cordova-oauth libraries for Ionic Framework that allowed mobile applications to work with OAuth providers like Google and Facebook. There are a lot of common questions around the protocol such as storing tokens, refreshing tokens, and implementing OAuth logic within code.

The goal in this episode is to clear up the common questions and give everyone a better understanding on how OAuth works as well as the best practicies.

In this episode I am joined by Brenda itReverie, a fellow application developer that I met when I was at NativeScript Developer Days 2017.

Brenda and I shift the focus away from software development for a moment and focus on hunting down and locking in a job in application development, a subject that is long, stressful, and never pleasant. In this episode we answer all your questions regarding getting called by recruiters and tackling those complicated algorithm and coding challenges given in the various interviews.

The goal of this episode is to give you some pointers towards being successful and giving you something to anticipate to make the process a little less stressful.

In this episode I'm joined by Carlos Santana who works on the Cloud Functions team at IBM.

Carlos and I get all your questions answered when it comes to what serverless is and how you can create your own very scalable functions that can be deployed on it. We name drop a few providers such as AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, but the focus is centered around IBM's Cloud Functions service which uses Apache OpenWhisk.

If you're into developing web applications, learning about functions as a service (FaaS) is for you.

In this episode I'm joined by Tara Manicsic who works as a Developer Advocate team at Progress Software.

Tara and I spend time discussing Progressive Web Applications (PWA) and how you can be effective building them with service workers, among other things, for mobile devices as well as standard desktop-based web browsers.

If you're into developing modern web and mobile applications, getting informed on Progressive Web Application (PWA) development is something you should consider.

In this episode I'm joined by Jim Clark who works as the Chief Architect at Atomist.

Jim and I spend a lot of time discussing how the pipeline model to software delivery can be improved by making it a workflow and event driven model instead with a service like Atomist. The pipeline approach can only get you so far and it is limited in how the appropriate teams can get the necessary notifications to function efficiently. Jim and I explore how to get beyond these common problems.
