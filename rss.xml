In this episode I talk about what I feel to be requirements in developing mobile applications.  I've broken these requirements into three main categories, being, the planning requirement, the execution requirement, and the post release marketing requirement.  Have you ever wondered the fees for releasing your application to the various app stores or what kind of development hardware you need?  Get all the information you need to get your app development business kick started.
